    "## 2. ABSTRACT CLASS\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Classes are those classes which cannot be instantiated or whose objects cannot be created. So we use an abstract class as a template and according to the need, we extend it and build on it before we can use it.They are basically subclasses of the abc(Abstract Base Class) module in python. A class is called abstract class only if it has at least one abstract method. An abstract method is a method which only has declaration and doesn't have definition or implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we inherit a abstract class as a parent to the child class, the child class should define all the abstract method present in parent class.If it is not done then child class also becomes abstract class automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Abstract Base Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining an abstract base class, we can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins, but can also help you when working in a large team or with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or not possible.
